## Active Work
- **Visual Refinement (User Feedback)**:
    - **Graph**: Changed to **50px Thick Light Purple (`#E0B0FF`)** line for bold visibility.
    - **Betting Box**: 
        - Simplified to **Solid Pale Yellow** (No internal glow/border).
        - Added `$` prefix to bet amounts.
    - **Proximity Effect**: Implemented a **"Spread Glow"** texture (soft fade-out) behind boxes instead of hard shapes.

## Recent Activity
- Modified `MainScene.ts` to overhaul visual styles (Graph thickness, colors, box aesthetics).
- Refined `box_glow_rect` texture generation to create a multi-layered soft spread effect.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add "Cash Out" button for active bets.
- [ ] Implement Leaderboard for biggest single win.
- [ ] Add background music (Ambient/Cyberpunk).
